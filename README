Overview
========

You won't find the most factored CSS and HTML you have ever seen, 
but it gets the job done (signing people up to our email list.)

Deployment
==========

(This is mostly for the Awesome Controller people to deploy to the production website. 
Currently we don't have a staging environment or anything.)

1. Create a `set_env.sh` script to set environment variables for our AWS access keys. Eg.:

  #! /bin/bash

  export ac_aws_access_key_id=foo;
  export ac_aws_secret_access_key=bar;
  export ac_s3_bucket=www.awesomecontroller.com

2. Source `set_env.sh`:

  $ source set_env.sh

3. Deploy to S3.

  $ rake s3


When you deploy, hit the live website 
and test that everything seems to work as expected. 
It might take a few seconds for the permission change to take effect,
so feel free to refresh a few times in the event that you get an error 
and believe that you set the permissions up correctly.

Testing
=======

Start a test HTTP server with:

  $ rake preview
