Overview
========

You won't find the most factored CSS and HTML you have ever seen, 
but it gets the job done (signing people up to our email list.)

Deployment
==========

(This is mostly for the Awesome Controller people to deploy to the production website. 
Currently we don't have a staging environment or anything.)

1. Run bundle to get the required gems.

2. Create a `set_env.sh` script to set environment variables for our AWS access keys.
   This file is ignored by default in the directory.

  $ cp set_env.sh.example set_env.sh
  Then edit to be the right values

3. Run the deploy script

  $ source set_env.sh && rake s3

When you deploy, hit the live website 
and test that everything seems to work as expected. 
It might take a few seconds for the permission change to take effect,
so feel free to refresh a few times in the event that you get an error 
and believe that you set the permissions up correctly.

Testing
=======

Start a test HTTP server with:

  $ rake preview
